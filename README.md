INSTALLATION
    git clone https://github.com/Mauryn24/simple_shell.git
    cd simple_shell
    gcc *.c -o hsh
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    Your shell should not have any memory leaks
    No more than 5 functions per file
    All your header files should be include guarded
    Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
    Write a README with the description of your project
    You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. Format, see Docker
TARGET OUTPUT
    Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
    The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)
Example of error with sh:

    $ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
    /bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
    $ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
    /bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
    $
Same error with your program hsh:

    $ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
    ./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
    $ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
    ./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
    $
COMPILATION
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
TESTING
Interactive mode:
    $ ./hsh
    ($) /bin/ls
    hsh main.c shell.c
    ($)
    ($) exit
    $
Non-interactive mode:
    $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
    hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
    $
    $ cat test_ls_2
    /bin/ls
    /bin/ls
    $
    $ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
    hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
    hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
    $
TASKS

MANDATORY:
1. README.md, man, AUTHORS
    Write a README
    Write a man for your shell.
    You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository.
2. Simple shell 0.1
    Write a UNIX command line interpreter.
    Your Shell should: Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line. The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed. The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features. The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs. If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again. Handle errors. You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
    You don’t have to: use the PATH implement built-ins handle special characters : ", ', `, , *, &, # be able to move the cursor handle commands with arguments
3. Simple shell 0.2
    Handle command lines with arguments
4. Simple shell 0.3
    Handle the PATH
5. Simple shell 0.4
    Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
    Usage: exit
    You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit
6. Simple shell 1.0
    Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
7. Write a blogpost "What happens when you type ls -l in the shell"
ADVANCED TASKS
1. Test suite
    Contribute to a test suite for your shell
2. Simple shell 0.2.1
    Write your own strtok function
3. Simple shell 0.4.1
    handle arguments for the built-in exit
4. Simple shell 0.4.2
    Handle Ctrl+C: your shell should not quit when the user inputs ^C
5. setenv, unsetenv
    Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands
6. cd
    Implement the builtin command cd
7. ;
    Handle the commands separator ;
8. alias
    Implement the alias builtin command
9. Comments
    Handle comments (#)
10. help
    Implement the help built-in
11. File as an input
    Your shell should take a file as a command line argument
